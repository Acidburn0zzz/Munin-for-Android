<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>named - Plugin to monitor named statistics</p> 
<h1>ABOUT</h1> 
<p>This is a bit experimental, we will have to see which statistics prove to have any meaning to get a feel with what happens on the nameserver.</p> 
<h1>USAGE</h1> 
<p>In your named.conf you must have statistics-interval set:</p> 
<pre> options {
    ...
    statistics-interval 1;
    ...
 };</pre> 
<p>The number is in minutes. At each interval just 3 lines is dumped. It can be desturbing if you usually read the logs yourself, but a 1 minute interval ensures very updated information to munin. 5 minutes is the maximum I'd say.</p> 
<p>The name of the file where syslog puts daemon output - ie the named statistics output. On solaris this is /var/adm/messages, on most linuxes it is /var/log/messages. But on Debian it is /var/log/daemon.log which is read restricted so we have to run as a group or user with read rights, or remove the restrictions on the log file.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>Configuration parameters for @@CONFDIR@@/named, if you need to override the defaults below:</p> 
<pre> [named]
  env.logfile   - set which log file to use</pre> 
<p>To ensure read access to the log files, you will need to add something like:</p> 
<pre> [named]
  group adm</pre> 
<h2>DEFAULT CONFIGURATION</h2> 
<pre> [named]
  env.logfile /var/adm/messages or /var/log/daemon.log</pre>
