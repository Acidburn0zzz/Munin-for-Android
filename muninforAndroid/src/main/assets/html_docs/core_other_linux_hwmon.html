<h1>NAME</h1> 
<pre>  hwmon - Multigraph plugin to monitor Linux hwmon drivers</pre> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Any Linux system with a modern kernel (2.6.something), with an accessible <code>/sys</code> filesystem and available drivers for hardware monitoring.</p> 
<p>Different kernels expose more or fewer probes through the <code>/sys</code> hwmon interfaces, but at least the recent 3.6 kernels expose the following:</p> 
<pre> - hardware sensors (also accessible via lm_sensors);
 - CPU core probes (Intel and AMD at least);
 - CPU power probes (AMD);
 - ACPI thermal zones (most x86/AMD64 CPUs);
 - video card temperatuers (open-source drivers).</pre> 
<p>The specifications, and this plugin, include support for voltage input, fan speed, temperature, current, power and humidity.</p> 
<p>Please note that on server-grade hardware, sensors are usually implemented through IPMI, which the kernel does not expose to userspace directly. For those systems, please refer to the <code>freeipmi</code> plugin.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>There is no environment configuration for this plugin on the node side. If you need to ignore some values, do so from the master directly.</p> 
<p>The data is being received directly by the kernel-configured parameters. Some of these parameters are initialized by lm_sensors depending on your driver and distribution, so while the plugin does not require you to have the package installed, it's still suggested.</p>
